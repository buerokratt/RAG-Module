# Contributor Guidelines

Welcome! This guide helps you set up the project locally for development and contributions. It also explains the coding standards used in the project along with the CI checks

## Local Setup

This project uses **uv** for Python packaging and virtual environments. Python is pinned to **3.12.10** in `pyproject.toml`.


### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd RAG-Module
```

### Step 2: Install uv
If uv is not already installed, install it via the official installer.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Restart your terminal or run: source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Install the Required Python Version
Use uv to install and manage Python 3.12.10.

```bash
uv python install 3.12.10
```

### Step 4: Recreate the Virtual Environment
From the project root (where `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are located), recreate the environment from the lockfile.

```bash
# Create .venv and install dependencies strictly from uv.lock
uv sync --frozen
```

**Notes:**
- `uv sync` creates a local `.venv/` directory by default and installs dependencies from `uv.lock`.
- If `--frozen` fails due to a stale lockfile, run `uv sync -p 3.12.10` (without `--frozen`) to resolve and update.

### Step 5: Activate the Environment (Optional)
Activate the virtual environment to use it directly.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -V  # Should output: Python 3.12.10
```

### Step 6: Run the Application

When running any Python programs (APIs or scripts) in a docker container or locally, always run with

```bash
uv run python app.py
```

instead of 

```bash
python3 app.py
```

This will make sure that regardless of whether you have activated the .venv environment or not uv will use virtual environment created instead of system level versions.


### Step 7: Setup pre-commit hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality checks run automatically before commits.

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```


This installs git hooks that will run configured checks (linting, formatting, etc.) on staged files before each commit.

#### Validate Pre-commit Setup
Test that the hooks are working correctly:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

This runs all pre-commit hooks on the entire codebase. Fix any issues that are reported.


**Note:** If pre-commit hooks fail during a commit, the commit will be blocked until you fix the issues and re-stage your changes.

## CI Checks

### Environment check

- Located in `.github/workflows/uv-env-check.yml`

- This GitHub actions check runs to check whether there are any conflicts between the lockfile and pyproject.toml. If it fails, then there has been some dependency update to the pyproject.toml without updating the lockfile.

### Type check for Python 

- Located in `.github/workflows/pyright-type-check.yml`

- This GitHub actions checks runs the Pyright type checker across the entire code-base to check for undeclared Python variables and objects. You can check the Pyright configuration in the `pyproject.toml` file. We use a `strict` configuration, so even objects being returned through frameworks and libraries should be either type-casted or should be validated using libraries such as `Pydantic`.


### Pytest Test-cases check

- Located in `.github/workflows/pytest-testcases-check.yml`

- This GitHub actions checks runs all Pytest test-cases unders the `tests/` folder.


### Ruff Python code format check

- Located in `.github/workflows/ruff-format-check.yml`

- This GitHub actions check runs the   `ruff format --check` on the entire codebase to detect any code incompliant with the project's code formatting standards which are configured in `pyproject.toml`

#### Ruff Lint check

- Located in `.github/workflows/ruff-lint-check.yml`

- This GitHub actions check runs the `ruff check` command on the entire code base to detect any code incompliant with the project's linting standards which are configured in `pyproject.toml`

### Gitleaks check

- Located in `.github/workflows/git-leaks-check.yml`

- This GitHub actions check uses the GitLeaks open source tool to check for potential secret/key leakages in the code. There is also a pre-commit hook configured with gitleaks to detect any possible secret leaks before even committing. 


## Installing New Dependencies to the Project (Python)

If you need to add a new Python dependency, **do not run `pip install` directly**.

We use `uv` to manage environments and lockfiles so that installs are reproducible in local development, CI, and containers.

### Follow This Process:

#### 1. Add the Dependency
Use `uv add` instead of `pip install`. This ensures both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are updated together.

```bash
uv add "package-name>=x.y,<x.(y+1)"
```

- Use a bounded version range (`>=` + `<`) to avoid uncontrolled upgrades.


#### 2. Re-sync Your Environment
After adding, re-sync to refresh your local `.venv`:

```bash
uv sync --reinstall
```

#### 3. Run Checks Locally
Make sure type checks, linter, and tests pass:

```bash
uv run pyright
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
```

#### 4. Commit Both Files
Always commit both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. If only one is updated, CI will fail (`uv sync --frozen` check).

```bash
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "added package-name dependency"
```

#### 5. Open a PR
CI will validate that the lockfile and environment are consistent. If you forgot to update the lockfile, the PR will fail with a clear error.

---

### Important Notes

- **Never edit `uv.lock` manually.** It is controlled by `uv`.
- **Never use `uv pip install` for permanent deps** â€” it only changes your local venv. Use `uv add` instead.
- If you remove a dependency, run:

```bash
uv remove package-name
uv sync --reinstall
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "removed package-name"
```
